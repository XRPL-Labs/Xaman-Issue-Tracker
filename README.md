# Xaman Issue Tracker

As the Xaman ecosystem relies on a combination of code repositories (App, Developer Console, etc.) this central repository will be used to centrally track bugs, improvements, suggestions &amp; release progress (using Projects & Project Boards).

- https://support.xumm.app

# Issues (issue tracker) vs. Developer Questions

Potential bugs, feature requests, technical suggestions, etc. belong here. If you are a developer and have questions about the XRP Ledger Protocol and Xaman, questions about integrations, etc., this is not the right place. Instead, check out the "Developer Questions" board at: https://xumm.readme.io/discuss
